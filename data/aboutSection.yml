  ### I am a problem solver.


  I enjoy the challenge that comes with being a software engineer. 
  Not just the puzzle of writing code, but writing clean and efficient code is what I enjoy the most. I
  enjoy all of the aspects of programming but my favorite part is the end result, 
  where the puzzle pieces come together and compile with no errors.
